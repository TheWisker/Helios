Welcome, Sudo User!

You've just unlocked the power of `sudo`. Here’s how to wield it wisely:

1. **Think Before You Type**: With `sudo`, you hold great power. Use it wisely and with intention!
   
2. **Less is More**: Call upon `sudo` only when truly needed - avoid running as root unless absolutely necessary!

3. **Type Carefully**: A single wayward command can wreak havoc. Double-check before hitting Enter!

4. **You’re Being Watched**: Your `sudo` actions are logged. Use this privilege with honor!

5. **Know Your Commands**: Equip yourself with knowledge. The command `man <command>` is your trusty aide!

Now go forth, and may your commands be swift and your errors few!
